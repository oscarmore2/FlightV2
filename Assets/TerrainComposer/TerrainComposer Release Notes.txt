folder to a package and import it into your new project. Be sure to include the TerrainComposer folder in Standard Assets.



TerrainComposer final version 1.12
----------------------------------

Features:
- Objects in object output can be instantiated as prefabs now.

Improvements:
- View only layers for selected output buttons. This is active on default now, can be switched off in TC Menu -> View -> Output Layers Only.
- Auto save global settings with timer, instead of on each lost focus window. Default is 5 minutes, can be changed in TC Menu -> Options -> Generate Settings.

Fixes:
- Grass layer, generate loop error.
- Non square heightmap y not seamless.


TerrainComposer final version 1.12
----------------------------------

Fixes:
- Image assigning in filters and subfilters.
- Image importing settings changes from filter and subfilters.


TerrainComposer final version 1.11
----------------------------------

Features: 
- Embedded assigning RTP Relief Terrain Pack shader. RTP is displayed under 'Splat Textures' in the terrain list. For it to work you need to have RTP.
  Shift click <RTP> to automatically assign the ReliefTerrain script to every terrain. The colormap of RTP will show, and can be selected with 
  auto search. For many terrain tiles it saves you tons of time assigning.

Improvements:
- Memory optimalization with loading texture list in filters. Texture can now only be loaded on generation, instead of loading every texture into memory. To use this to auto
  search has to be set right and 'Load on generate' should be enabled after selected the texture. 'Load on generate' disables automatically after selecting, because on enabling
  it will automatically set all the import settings for the textures to read/write so the TC can read from them. 
- Heightmap export displays 1 single file now, a number is added to the end of each terrain on exporting.
- Background color can be disabled.


Fixes:
- Video of creating terrain on Youtube was blurry, added new video and changed the link.
- Saving of global settings. 
- Heigthmap export.
- Assigning heightmap in terrain list.


TerrainComposer final version 1.1
---------------------------------

Features:
- Embedded video tutorial buttons. The major components of TerrainComposer are short and brief explained. To activate/deactive can be done with the new help button.
- Works directly in Web Player mode now.
- Works with WorldComposer.
- Can directly import splat maps from example WorldMachine in filters now, enable it with the toggle 'Splatmap' which is the image settings (filter input has to be on image). 
  The first 4 splats detail textures in the splat layer will be selected. 
- Raw files can have non-square resolution now.
- Auto frame generating speed, is displayed next to the generate button. The Unity Editor doesn't drop below this framerate while generating. You can switch between 
  auto speed and manual speed by click the 'Auto' button.
- Use TC project as a prefab, so you can share the project with multiple Scenes, can be activated/deactived in TC Menu -> Generate Settings -> Project Prefab Mode.
- Embedded TriPlanar shader (Optional). In TC Terrain List -> Splat Textures -> <TriPlanar>.
- Colormap option for standard Unity Terrain Shader. Activate/Deactivate by shift clicking <Colormap> in TC Terrain List -> Splat Textures.
- Global Parameters in Quick Tools for changing Heights and Steepness intput. Here you also can choose to stitch heightmap and splatmap automatically after generating.

Improvements:
- For Unity 4.x added material and normal maps in TC Terrain List -> Splat Textures. To benefit from TC multi terrain editing.
- Create a parent for terrains and object in the object layer automatically with the 'create' button.
- Detail Resolution in TC Terrain List can be typed manually, because detail resolution doesn't have to be power of 2.
- Copy terrain material to multi terrains in Unity4 (optional).
- Help button 'H' for curves. Will open a new window with the image of the curve with input on horizontal axis and output on vertical axis.
- Default perlin option in the 'Curve' button -> Line -> Default Perlin. Choosing this will set default perlin curve.
- Colormap splat textures for colormap creation are assigned automatically.

- Warnings in Unity 4 that Unity 3.5 code gives.
